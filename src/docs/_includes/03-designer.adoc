= Admin Designer

The aim of https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-designer[Admin Designer^] is to make it easier to customize Admin theme and Admin Template.

== What is it?

This is the same http://github.com/adminfaces/admin-showcase[Admin Showcase^] application with `admin template` and `admin theme` bundled inside instead of being project dependencies.

It uses http://wildfly-swarm.io/[Wildfly Swarm^] to run the `exploded` application so one can change the theme or template and see the modifications without needing to restart the application.

== Objectives

The initial idea was to speed AdminFaces development but it turns out that it can easy `contributions` from non Java developers (like designers and frontend developers) as the project is about front end components and layout.

Also another great feature of Admin Designer is the possibility to *download the customized project* as a maven project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The downloaded project is the https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-starter[Admin Starter^] with modified admin theme and template embedded in the project.

NOTE: This is the most flexible approach but at the same time `you lose the updates on Admin Theme and template projects` because you don't depend on them anymore.
====

== How it works

In application root directory:

. First start the application by running the command:
+
----
./mvnw wildfly-swarm:run (or mvnw.cmd wildfly-swarm:run)
----
+
. Second edit any less file in directory https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-designer/tree/master/src/main/resources/less[`src/main/resources/less`^].
. Now to compile the application using:
+
----
 ./mvnw compile (or mvnw.cmd compile)
----
TIP: If you don't want to compile every time you change a less file, use the flag `-Dlesscss.watch=true`. Or use a tool like http://brackets.io/[brackets^] with https://github.com/jdiehl/brackets-less-autocompile[less extension^] installed.
+
. Finally when you're done you can download the customized `theme` and `template` as a *sample maven project* or as separated jar files;

The changes made to less files should be visible in running application `http://localhost:8080/showcase`

NOTE: There is no need to stop and run the application again.
