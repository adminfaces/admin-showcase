== Demo 

Showcase is available on http://admin-showcase-admin-showcase.7e14.starter-us-west-2.openshiftapps.com/showcase/index.xhtml[Openshift here^].

IMPORTANT: The demo runs on the Openshift starter which is a platform used just for testing and not for production. So it's likely the showcase may be slow or *even down*.

== Running locally

There are several ways to run Admin Showcase on your machine. Just clone this repository and use one of the alternatives described below.

=== Using an application server


Admin Showcase is compatible with most JavaEE 6 and 7 application servers.

Just build the application with maven using `mvn clean package -DskipTests` and deploy the resulting `showcase.war` into a JavaEE 6 or greater server.

NOTE: No configuration is needed.

Following is the list of tested servers:

== Testing

To execute functional tests you need to activate the `tests` profile and choose the application server also using a maven profile, ex:
